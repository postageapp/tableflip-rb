MySQL Table Migration Tool

## Background

Maybe you have a number of large tables that need to be packed up and moved
somewhere else. Maybe you've tried other methods that almost work but don't
quite. This might be your only hope.

## Inspiration

## Caveats

This tool makes an extraordinary number of assumptions about how your data
is structured and what gems you have available. By some small miracle it might
work on your project, but it has an equally large chance of not working at all.

Needless to say, this is not a fully functional, battle-tested tool. Yet.
